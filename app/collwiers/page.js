        <ul>
          <li>You're juggling work, family, and endless responsibilities—but feel like you're running on empty</li>
          <li>You have "everything" on paper, but something still feels missing</li>
          <li>You've tried self-help books, podcasts, and advice—but nothing sticks</li>
          <li>You feel isolated, even when you're surrounded by people</li>
          <li>You're tired of surface-level friendships that leave you feeling heavier, not lighter</li>
          <li>You know you're "meant for more," but don't know where to start</li>
        </ul>
        <p style={{fontWeight: '500', fontSize: '1.2rem'}}>You're not broken. You're just carrying too much, alone.</p>

        <h2>The Real Problem Isn't Your Life. It's That You're Living It Alone.</h2>
        <p>You don't need another checklist. You don't need to "try harder" or "think more positively."</p>
        <p>What you need is:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Real connection</strong> — not surface-level small talk or mutual venting</li>
          <li><strong>Guided support</strong> — someone to walk with you, not just tell you what to do</li>
          <li><strong>A safe space</strong> — where you can be honest without judgment or guilt</li>
          <li><strong>Clarity</strong> — not just motivation, but actual steps forward</li>
        </ul>
        <p>CollWi gives you structured group coaching that meets you where you are—overwhelmed, disconnected, and ready for something real.</p>

        <h2>Why CollWi Works When Everything Else Hasn't</h2>
        <p>Most support feels generic. Impersonal. Like it's designed for "everyone" but speaks to no one.</p>
        <p><strong>CollWi is different because:</strong></p>

        <h2>You Deserve More Than "Fine."</h2>
        <p>You've spent years taking care of everyone else.</p>
        <p>You've silenced your own needs because your life looks "good enough" from the outside.</p>

        <div className="highlight">

          <p>You can be grateful <em>and</em> want more.</p>
          <p>You can have a stable life <em>and</em> crave meaning, connection, and purpose.</p>
          <p>You don't have to wait until everything falls apart to ask for support.</p>
