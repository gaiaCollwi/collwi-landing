          <p>
            If you're a woman leader looking for support, you've probably come across both Chief and CollWi. 
            At first glance, they might seem similar—both are communities for ambitious women. But they're 
            actually solving completely different problems.
          </p>

          <p>Here's the breakdown.</p>

          <h2>What Chief Does</h2>
          <p>
            Chief is a professional network for women executives. If you're VP-level or above, Chief offers:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Access to physical clubhouses in major cities</li>
            <li>Core groups (peer coaching circles for career advancement)</li>
            <li>Executive coaching and leadership development</li>
            <li>Training from institutions like Wharton School of Business</li>
            <li>Networking with other C-suite women (44% of members are in the C-suite)</li>
            <li>Annual summits and industry events</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            <strong>Cost:</strong> $7,900-$10,900 per year
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Target:</strong> Senior women leaders (VP, C-suite, founders with significant funding)
          </p>

          <h2>What CollWi Does</h2>
          <p>
            CollWi is a peer support platform for women who are succeeding but still feel lonely. We offer:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>8-week facilitated cohorts (4-6 women per group)</li>
            <li>Weekly 90-minute video calls</li>
            <li>Trained facilitators (not therapists or coaches)</li>
            <li>Safe space to talk about loneliness, burnout, identity, guilt—the stuff you don't say out loud</li>
            <li>Real connection, not career advancement</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            <strong>Cost:</strong> $300-500 for 8 weeks
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Target:</strong> All ambitious women (founders, managers, mid-career professionals, anyone feeling exhausted and alone)
          </p>

          <h2>The Key Difference</h2>
          <p>
            Chief is about <em>getting ahead</em>. CollWi is about <em>not feeling alone</em>.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you need to expand your professional network, advance your career, or connect with other 
            executives for business purposes, Chief is excellent. You'll meet powerful women, get career 
            coaching, and gain access to opportunities.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you're exhausted, isolated, and tired of performing—if you need a space where success isn't 
            the goal—CollWi is for you. We're not about networking. We're about finally being honest about 
            how hard it is to hold everything together.
          </p>

          <h2>Can You Do Both?</h2>
          <p>
            Absolutely. In fact, many Chief members also need CollWi.
          </p>

          <p>
            Chief helps you climb the ladder. CollWi helps you not feel alone while you're on it.
          </p>

          <p>
            One addresses your career. The other addresses your humanity.
          </p>

          <h2>Who Should Choose Chief</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>You're VP-level or above</li>
            <li>You need professional networking and career coaching</li>
            <li>You want access to exclusive events and training</li>
            <li>You can afford $8,000-11,000 per year</li>
            <li>You're looking for business connections and opportunities</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Who Should Choose CollWi</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>You're succeeding but still feel lonely</li>
            <li>You're tired of surface-level friendships and networking events</li>
            <li>You need a safe space to stop performing</li>
            <li>You want real connection, not career advancement</li>
            <li>You're looking for affordable, structured peer support</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
          <p>
            Chief and CollWi aren't competitors. They're complements.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you're a Chief member who still feels isolated despite the success and the network, CollWi 
            might be exactly what you need. If you're considering Chief but it feels too expensive or too 
            career-focused, try CollWi first.
          </p>

          <p>
            Your career matters. But so does your mental health. You don't have to choose between them.
