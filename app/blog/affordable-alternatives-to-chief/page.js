          Chief is incredible. But $8,000-11,000 per year isn't feasible for everyone. Here are five alternatives.
        </p>

        <div className="prose prose-lg max-w-none">
          <p>
            Chief has built an amazing community for women executives. The clubhouses, the network, the 
            coaching—it's top-tier. But let's be honest: at $7,900-$10,900 per year, it's out of reach for 
            most women.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you're an ambitious woman looking for community and support but can't justify Chief's price 
            tag, here are five alternatives worth considering.
          </p>

          <h2>1. CollWi ($300-500 for 8 weeks)</h2>
          <p><strong>What it is:</strong> Facilitated peer support cohorts for ambitious women</p>
          <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Women who need emotional support, not career networking</p>

          <p>
            CollWi isn't about advancing your career. It's about addressing the loneliness and burnout that 
            come with success. You join a cohort of 4-6 women, meet weekly for 8 weeks, and talk about the 
            stuff you don't say out loud anywhere else.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Pros:</strong> Affordable, structured, facilitator-led, focuses on connection over achievement
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Cons:</strong> Not a professional network, no career coaching
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Cost:</strong> $300-500 for 8 weeks (~$40-60 per week)
          </p>

          <h2>2. Local Women's Chambers of Commerce (Varies, often $200-600/year)</h2>
          <p><strong>What it is:</strong> Regional business networking groups for women</p>
          <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Women who want local, in-person connections</p>

          <p>
            Most cities have a women's chamber of commerce or professional association. They offer networking 
            events, educational workshops, and business development resources at a fraction of Chief's cost.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Pros:</strong> Affordable, local, in-person, business-focused
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Cons:</strong> Less curated than Chief, can feel like traditional networking
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Examples:</strong> Greater Houston Women's Chamber, New York Women's Chamber, local 
            Women in Business chapters
          </p>

          <h2>3. Online Masterminds and Peer Groups (Free to $2,000/year)</h2>
          <p><strong>What it is:</strong> Small peer accountability groups, often industry-specific</p>
          <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Women who want peer support without formal structure</p>

          <p>
            Masterminds are small groups (4-8 people) who meet regularly to share challenges, brainstorm 
            solutions, and hold each other accountable. Some are free (self-organized), others charge for 
            facilitation.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Pros:</strong> Flexible, tailored to your needs, can be free or low-cost
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Cons:</strong> Quality varies, can dissolve if not well-facilitated
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Where to find them:</strong> LinkedIn groups, Slack communities, founder forums
          </p>

          <h2>4. Ellevate Network ($179-249/year)</h2>
          <p><strong>What it is:</strong> Global professional network for women</p>
          <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Women who want networking and career development on a budget</p>

          <p>
            Ellevate is a professional network with local chapters, virtual events, and online resources. 
            It's more accessible than Chief but still focused on career advancement.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Pros:</strong> Affordable, global network, virtual and in-person events
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Cons:</strong> Less exclusive than Chief, can feel corporate
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Cost:</strong> $179-249/year
          </p>

          <h2>5. Free Online Communities (Facebook Groups, Slack, Discord)</h2>
          <p><strong>What it is:</strong> Peer-run communities for women in various industries</p>
          <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Women who want access to a large network at no cost</p>

          <p>
            There are thousands of free online communities for women entrepreneurs, women in tech, women 
            founders, etc. They're less structured than paid options but can still provide value.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Pros:</strong> Free, large networks, diverse perspectives
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Cons:</strong> No curation, can be overwhelming, people ghost frequently
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Examples:</strong> Women in Product, Dreamers & Doers, Founders Network (for women)
          </p>

          <h2>How to Choose</h2>
          <p>Ask yourself:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>What do I need most?</strong> Career advancement, emotional support, or business connections?</li>
            <li><strong>What can I afford?</strong> Be honest about your budget.</li>
            <li><strong>Do I want structure or flexibility?</strong> Some people thrive with cohorts, others prefer drop-in communities.</li>
            <li><strong>Online or in-person?</strong> Geographic location matters.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
          <p>
            Chief is amazing if you can afford it. But if you can't, you're not out of options.
